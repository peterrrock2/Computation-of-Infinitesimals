# Computation-of-Infinitesimals

This is a repository containing the main functions that I used in order to complete my thesis work. 
There is an included zip file here containing all of my insane ramblings for any of those that are interested,
but, insofar as what is necessary to start working with things in the multispace of curves goes, what is
contained in the main part of this repository should be enough to get started. Please note that this 
(albeit very small) file contains minimal comments, but, providing that I have actually planned my time 
appropriately for once, the main "package" file should receive some updates within the next couple of 
months with more clarifications.
